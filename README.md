# webkit-experiment

A quick proof of concept to test out [Node Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) development.

I ended up building a very noddy little finder app that explores your file system. To see it in action just drop a node webkit prebuilt binary into the folder and then double click it.
